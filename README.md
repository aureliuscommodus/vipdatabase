<pre><code>1)You don't realy expect   that if you  buy a  database with billions of contacts 
such  as  office@ or  contact@ 
you have made  a  good  acquisition.
You buy a huge  database with trash and what?
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
2)You  possible  have imagined  that  behind  office@ or  contact@ you  would  find something  like   :
1) Bored  assistant manager( with  chating  as you   could also imagine)
or:
2)<s> Auto-proclamado geek</s>(the dude that is  busy  with web page updating  and  playing  some online  game)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
This  database is not offering billions of  records  with zero value , one  reason for that  is  the 
vast majority of  ourc recors  are tested  using  2 methods : validation and ping.
You shouls  also consider that we dont  realy know  if the  persons  behind  our record  are  dead , 
fired  or retired.
