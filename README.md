<b><center><i>><h2>Valuable information is  rare  and costly !</center></b></i></h2>
<b><i> Why is this  database so  spceial and   why do buy  from  us ?(Instead  of  <s>FAQ</s>):</i></b>
<ul>
<li> Valuable  information is spare.Hard  to  get.  Spoiled kids  will never   get  you  valuable  information.

<li> Spoiled  kids  and intelectual  thieves will make fancy  web pages  and will use   nice looking(with ears)  speech in order  to sell  you  information  with no value .You will  found out that  you  threw money without  no  informational  gain.

<li> Valuable  information  is not  obtained  with  a toll like  spoiled kids  and   intelectual  thieves .There is no magical tool  you cand  download  from internet use click , next   , ok  and problem  is  solved.

<li>There is no  real email  databse  with cheap price.</ul>

<pre><code>1)You don't really expect   that if you  buy a  database with billions of contacts  such  as  office@ or  contact@ , you buy and what?
you have made  a  good  acquisition.</code></pre>

<pre><code>
2)You  possible  have imagined  that  behind  office@ or  contact@ you  would  find something  like   :
1) Bored  assistant manager( with  chating  as you   could also imagine)
or:
2)<s> Auto-proclamado geek</s>(the dude that is  busy  with web page updating  and  playing  some online  game)
